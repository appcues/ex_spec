## ExSpec

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/drewolson/ex_spec.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/drewolson/ex_spec) [![Hex Version](http://img.shields.io/hexpm/v/ex_spec.svg?style=flat)](https://hex.pm/packages/ex_spec) [![Hex docs](http://img.shields.io/badge/hex.pm-docs-green.svg?style=flat)](https://hexdocs.pm/ex_spec)

ExSpec is a simple wrapper around ExUnit that adds Rspec-style macros. Specifically, it adds `describe`, `context` and `it`.

While it takes inspiration from Rspec, ExSpec is significantly simplier. The `describe` and `context` macros have only two functions:

1. Aid test organization
2. Prepend to the message of any `it` defined within their do blocks

Furthermore, `describe` and `context` are aliases and function identically.

The `it` macro is identical to `ExUnit.Case.test` except that it is aware of the messages of its surrounding `describe` and `context` blocks.

Other than the functionality described above, ExSpec is just ExUnit. When `use`ing `ExSpec`, any options provided will be passed to `ExUnit.Case` (e.g. `async: true`).

A simple example is shown below. For more examples, see the tests.

### Example

```elixir
defmodule PersonTest do
  use ExSpec, async: true

  describe "name" do
    context "with first and last name" do
      it "joins the names with a space" do
        drew = %Person{first_name: "Drew", last_name: "Olson"}

        assert Person.name(drew) == "Drew Olson"
      end
    end

    context "with only a first name" do
      it "returns the first name" do
        drew = %Person{first_name: "Drew", last_name: nil}

        assert Person.name(drew) == "Drew"
      end
    end
  end
end
```

### Installation

Add `ex_spec` to your `mix.exs` dependencies:

```elixir
def deps do
  [{:ex_spec, "~> 1.0.0", only: :test}]
end
```
